## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Iâ€™m an embedded systems developer working with C and Arduino to build hardware applications that interact with the physical world. This repository contains a variety of projects focused on circuit design, sensor integration, and real-time programming. Whether you're a hobbyist or a professional looking to explore embedded systems, you'll find useful resources and examples to help you get started with your own hardware projects.

A key aspect of my work is circuit design. I design custom circuits for a wide range of applications, from simple LED projects to more complex sensor-based systems. Using tools like Eagle and KiCad, I create schematic diagrams, design PCB layouts, and ensure that each circuit is optimized for performance and reliability. I also work with breadboards and prototyping techniques to validate designs before moving to the final product.

Sensor integration plays a pivotal role in many of my projects. I interface various sensors, including temperature, humidity, motion, and pressure sensors, with Arduino boards to collect real-world data. Using analog-to-digital conversion and communication protocols like I2C and SPI, I ensure seamless data acquisition and processing. My projects cover a wide range of sensor-based applications, from environmental monitoring to motion detection and control systems.

In real-time programming, I write efficient code to manage timing, control loops, and event handling with minimal latency. Whether it's controlling motors, processing sensor data, or managing communication between devices, I focus on creating responsive systems that can operate in real-time. I also optimize code to run within the resource constraints typical of embedded systems.

Feel free to explore my projects, fork them, or collaborate. I hope you find inspiration and practical solutions for your own embedded systems work. Thanks for checking out my repository!
